# Known technical debt

Recorded so it is not rediscovered as a surprise.

- **Order-dependent test files.** Eight files share Tk roots and
  fake-driver classes across tests via `global`, preserving the
  behaviour of the original scripts. They cannot be run in isolation and
  would break under `pytest-xdist`. Convert to module-scoped fixtures as
  each experiment is touched in Waves 3 and 5.
- **Two test styles coexist**: converted section tests using the `check`
  fixture, and wrapped collector tests. Documented in
  `tests/README.md`.
- **`core.driver_registry`** remains as a deprecation shim. Remove once
  nothing external imports it.
- **Five `int(float(...))` call sites remain in the experiments** — 4PP
  points and reversals, IV points, runs and cycles. Wave 2 built the
  validators that replace them but deliberately did not touch an
  experiment file; Waves 3 and 5 swap them over as each experiment is
  wired up. The seven in `drivers/` parse SCPI error codes and are
  correct as they are.
- **`SampleRegistry` is process-local**, like Wave 1's ownership
  manager. If the answer to "can two instances of the app run at once?"
  turns out to be yes, both need revisiting together.
- **Cancellation cannot preempt a reading in progress.** The settle
  delay is handed to the instrument with `set_source_delay()`, so it
  happens inside the driver's blocking `measure()`. The honest bound is
  one reading, and `test_4pp_lifecycle.py` measures the rest of the path
  rather than asserting it. Moving the settle into `run.sleep()` would
  make cancellation near-instant but would change *where the settle
  happens*, which is a measurement parameter and not a UI detail — it
  needs a bench comparison before it goes near real hardware.
- **`test_4pp.py` still drives `_do_run()` on the main thread.** Its
  green says nothing about threading; that is `test_4pp_lifecycle.py`'s
  job. Left as-is deliberately: churning a 434-line passing test file is
  where a real regression hides.
