# Changelog

Newest first. Append-only: entries are not edited once written, because
this is the record of *why something changed and when* — the record of
what is true *now* lives in `docs/`.

The work so far was organised as numbered waves adopting one code
review. That numbering ends with Wave 7; later entries are just entries.

## Documentation rebuild

Five patches replacing four root documents that had grown to carry a
plan, a changelog and a reference manual at once — and had begun
disagreeing with the code and with themselves.

- `docs-skeleton-v1` — vault tree, frontmatter schema, generators, guards
- `docs-instruments-v1` — one note per driver, deviations rehomed
- `docs-experiments-v1` — one note per measurement, script archaeology
- `docs-architecture-v1` — house rules, faults, the `core/` map
- `docs-retire-v1` — bench pages, the review index, the old files deleted

What it corrected on the way through is listed in
`docs/reference/migration-status.md`. The mechanism that stops it
recurring: **a documentation claim a machine can check is not written by
a human.** Driver envelopes, commissioning status, deviation numbers and
the review index are all generated, and `tests/test_docs.py` fails if a
committed copy disagrees with a fresh build.
